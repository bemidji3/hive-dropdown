# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Make sure you have the correct version of npm and node that is required to run the app

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To edit the dropdown item data, navigate to `src/views/DropdownView/config.js` and you can edit the data there

# A COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION

(1) I messed around for a while trying to get the text to ellipsize when there is an overflow of selected items, but was unable to get it to work
(2) The dropdown also takes a value prop that can be bound as an object of objects that reflects the selected items from the dropdown
